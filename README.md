# ðŸ“Š Stock Sentiment Chatbot

A conversational AI chatbot built with **Rasa** and **Python** that analyzes **business news sentiment** for different companies and suggests whether to invest in them or avoid them.

It uses:
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** to identify company names in user queries.
- **Sentiment Analysis data** from pre-processed CSV files (`companies_sentiment.csv`).
- **Custom Rasa actions** to generate stock investment advice.
